## Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

Welcome to this Brain Tumor Detection and Classification project! This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive study on the detection and classification of brain tumors using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
Through the use of a large and diverse dataset (Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset) containing images of brain scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and non-tumor cases, we evaluate the performance of several models, 
including Vision Transformer (ViT), ResNet50, VGG16, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into the capabilities of these models and their potential applications in improving medical diagnostics and patient care.
